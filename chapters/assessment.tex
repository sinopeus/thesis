\section{Hypothesis}
Have we reached our goals?
\section{Strengths \& weaknesses}
How thorough is our methodology? Comparison with
\cite{dik2008,dik2009,mambrini2012}.
\section{Contribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item method
\item corpus
\end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item What are the major patterns in the observations? (Refer to spatial and temporal variations.)
% \item What are the relationships, trends and generalizations among the results?
% \item What are the exceptions to these patterns or generalizations?
% \item What are the likely causes (mechanisms) underlying these patterns resulting predictions?
% \item Is there agreement or disagreement with previous work?
% \item Interpret results in terms of background laid out in the introduction - what is the relationship of the present results to the original question?
% \item What is the implication of the present results for other unanswered questions in earth sciences, ecology, environmental policy, etc....?
% \item Multiple hypotheses: There are usually several possible explanations for results. Be careful to consider all of these rather than simply pushing your favorite one. If you can eliminate all but one, that is great, but often that is not possible with the data in hand. In that case you should give even treatment to the remaining possibilities, and try to indicate ways in which future work may lead to their discrimination.
% \item Avoid bandwagons: A special case of the above. Avoid jumping a currently fashionable point of view unless your results really do strongly support them. 
% \item What are the things we now know or understand that we didn't know or understand before the present work?
% \item Include the evidence or line of reasoning supporting each interpretation.
% \item What is the significance of the present results: why should we care?

\section{Further work}
\label{sec:further_work}
\subsection{Improving the language model}
\subsubsection{Larger training sets}
\begin{itemize}
\item mainly: TLG holds much more text but does not free it
\item connection with projects like Open Philology: build large tagged
corpora using crowdsourcing
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Linguistic foreknowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item simplicity is strength of model
\item can we use foreknowledge strategically?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Integration with other resources}
\subsubsection{Expanding the range of tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item stemming
\item named entity recognition
\item semantic role labeling
\item deep parsing
\end{itemize}
% \section{Named entity recognition}
% \label{sec:ner}

% Named entity recognition is a subdiscipline in natural language
% processing which is concerned with the automatic extraction and
% localisation of all kinds of names from texts. It has been used
% extensively in literary texts with a view to discern the importance of
% certain characters throughout the text. The KU Leuven's long-standing
% Prosopographia Ptolemaica project, which aims to be a repository of
% all inhabitants of Egypt between 300 and 30 B.C., could easily benefit
% from these techniques. The abundant manual labour that has gone into
% the project could be fed as training data to and then supplemented by
% a named entity recognition engine that could also categorise personal
% names by any criteria and establish contextual relations between
% them. To take a very rudimentary example, the name 'Alexander' could
% be retrieved in all texts and a cluster of related names generated, so
% that related individuals may be placed in a web of relations; or one
% could ask, by combining the already present linguistic annotation, to
% display all adjectives which accompany the name 'Alexander'.

% It could even go further than this and also include other particular
% names, such as places, distances, monetary units, weights, and so
% on. Historians could create a comprehensive overview of, for instance,
% the inflation of Egyptian currency, or map out trade connections using
% a search for all mentions of currency, weight and places which are in
% proximity to each other.

\subsection{Refining the corpus}
\label{sec:refiningcorpus}

\subsubsection{Collaborative editing}
\label{sec:collaborative}
% The IDP project is heading into crowdsourcing territory at full steam,
% and excluding our own work from this movement would be inserting a
% shrill note into this symphony. All data is placed on GitHub at
% \url{https://github.com/sinopeus/tjufy}, freely accessible and
% editable for all.

% This opens promising avenues of inquiry that do not have a direct
% relation to this thesis. For instance, it can in the future be
% integrated into SoSOL and absorbed into the larger codebase for the
% IDP project if it does not create too much overhead for the current
% developers (the technical back end of the IDP seems to be labyrinthine
% and adding new layers of complexity might be off-putting). It could
% even grow into a separate project which itself could be linked to
% \texttt{papyri.info} as the HGV, APIS and Trismegistos currently are,
% by a common system of indexation.

% Making the code publically available to all also has the advantage of
% the public eye inspecting the texts; using solely automatic analysis
% is bound to deliver an inaccurate result, however small that
% inaccuracy may be, as creating a NLP engine perfectly capable of
% understanding language would be the equivalent of creating a perfect
% artificial intelligence. Therefore, considering the size of the
% corpus, one must rely upon the intelligence of the community. In the
% same way open source software backed by large communities is often of
% excellent quality due to public inspection, the potential for a
% crowdsourced corpus is immense.
