This chapter is meant as an evocation of the potential of a fully annotated corpus of the papyri for further research.

\section{Collaborative editing} % (fold)
\label{sec:collaborativeediting}

The IDP project is heading into crowdsourcing territory at full steam, and
excluding our own work from this movement would be inserting a shrill note into
this symphony. All data is placed on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/sinopeus/tjufy}, freely accessible and editable for
all. 

This opens promising avenues of inquiry that do not have a direct relation
to this thesis. For instance, it can in the future be integrated into SoSOL and
absorbed into the larger codebase for the IDP project if it does not create too
much overhead for the current developers (the technical back end of the IDP
seems to be labyrinthine and adding new layers of complexity might be
off-putting). It could even grow into a separate project which itself could be
linked to papyri.info as the HGV, APIS and Trismegistos currently are, by a
common system of indexation.

Making the code publically available to all also has the advantage of the
public eye inspecting the texts; using solely automatic analysis is bound to
deliver an inaccurate result, however small that inaccuracy may be, as creating
a NLP engine perfectly capable of understanding language would be the
equivalent of creating a perfect artificial intelligence. Therefore,
considering the size of the corpus, we must rely upon the intelligence of the
community. In the same way open source software is often among the best of
software due to public inspection, the potential for a crowdsourced corpus is
immense.

\section{Corpus-based grammars and lexica} % (fold)
\label{sec:corpusbasedgrammars}

Expanding our method to other texts might bring the benefit of comprehensive
corpus-based grammars and lexica, which can integrate available data on the fly
and create a self-updating and reliable web of grammatical knowledge. Instead
of focusing mainly upon a few choice authors or laboriously trudging through
the huge wealth of ancient Greek literature to linearly create lexica and
grammars, we could harness all of it at once in a quantitatively precise and
easily visualisable way.

\section{Historical and variational linguistics} % (fold)
\label{sec:histlinguistics}

The language of the papyri has an important role to play in the historical
linguistics of Greek; once a full annotation has been achieved, it could be
possible to implement the same methods used for synchronic language processing
to map language changes in a statistical way; it could be possible to estimate
the transition probabilities for diachronic grammatical evolutions, which has
the potential to create a picture of the evolution of Greek that would be both
comprehensive and precise. It even has potential on a comparative level; given
the long history and meandering evolutionary trajectory of the Greek language,
we could observe from the data catalysts for language evolution in one
direction or the other and apply that comparatively.

We might also win valuable insight into language diversity in Egypt; using the
paraliterary data already available from the Trismegistos, linguistic phenomena
and evolutions could be visualised on a map and give insight into the diatopic,
diastratic and diaphasic variation of Egyptian koin\^e.
