% % \section{Named entity recognition}
% % \label{sec:ner}

% % Named entity recognition is a subdiscipline in natural language
% % processing which is concerned with the automatic extraction and
% % localisation of all kinds of names from texts. It has been used
% % extensively in literary texts with a view to discern the importance of
% % certain characters throughout the text. The KU Leuven's long-standing
% % Prosopographia Ptolemaica project, which aims to be a repository of
% % all inhabitants of Egypt between 300 and 30 B.C., could easily benefit
% % from these techniques. The abundant manual labour that has gone into
% % the project could be fed as training data to and then supplemented by
% % a named entity recognition engine that could also categorise personal
% % names by any criteria and establish contextual relations between
% % them. To take a very rudimentary example, the name 'Alexander' could
% % be retrieved in all texts and a cluster of related names generated, so
% % that related individuals may be placed in a web of relations; or one
% % could ask, by combining the already present linguistic annotation, to
% % display all adjectives which accompany the name 'Alexander'.

% % It could even go further than this and also include other particular
% % names, such as places, distances, monetary units, weights, and so
% % on. Historians could create a comprehensive overview of, for instance,
% % the inflation of Egyptian currency, or map out trade connections using
% % a search for all mentions of currency, weight and places which are in
% % proximity to each other.

% \subsection{Refining the corpus}
% \label{sec:refiningcorpus}

% \subsubsection{Collaborative editing}
% \label{sec:collaborative}
% % The IDP project is heading into crowdsourcing territory at full steam,
% % and excluding our own work from this movement would be inserting a
% % shrill note into this symphony. All data is placed on GitHub at
% % \url{https://github.com/sinopeus/tjufy}, freely accessible and
% % editable for all.

% % This opens promising avenues of inquiry that do not have a direct
% % relation to this thesis. For instance, it can in the future be
% % integrated into SoSOL and absorbed into the larger codebase for the
% % IDP project if it does not create too much overhead for the current
% % developers (the technical back end of the IDP seems to be labyrinthine
% % and adding new layers of complexity might be off-putting). It could
% % even grow into a separate project which itself could be linked to
% % \texttt{papyri.info} as the HGV, APIS and Trismegistos currently are,
% % by a common system of indexation.

% % Making the code publically available to all also has the advantage of
% % the public eye inspecting the texts; using solely automatic analysis
% % is bound to deliver an inaccurate result, however small that
% % inaccuracy may be, as creating a NLP engine perfectly capable of
% % understanding language would be the equivalent of creating a perfect
% % artificial intelligence. Therefore, considering the size of the
% % corpus, one must rely upon the intelligence of the community. In the
% % same way open source software backed by large communities is often of
% % excellent quality due to public inspection, the potential for a
% % crowdsourced corpus is immense.
