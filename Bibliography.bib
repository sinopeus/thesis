	Abstract = {Computational Papyrology
David Mimno and Hanna Wallach

The arid conditions of Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt preserved a
remarkable number of papyrus documents. While these documents provide
an unparalleled window into the culture of Egypt following the
conquest of Alexander the Great, they can be difficult to work
with. The quality of preservation varies: some documents are nearly
complete while others are highly fragmentary. Furthermore, the
language and cultural context of the papyri are unfamiliar even to
scholars with a strong background in Greco-Roman antiquity. It is
therefore these oldest documents that can benefit the most from
cutting-edge text processing technologies. In this paper, we use
advanced text processing algorithms to enhance the reconstruction,
searchability and analysis of an existing online corpus of papyri.

The Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDBDP) consists of over
50,000 non-literary texts, such as letters, contracts, and tax
records. The corpus is primarily in Greek, with small amounts of Latin
and Egyptian, in its Demotic and Coptic forms. Each document consists
of an XML formatted text along with a find location and an estimate of
its creation date. In most cases a papyrologist has manually entered
reconstructions for missing and unclear text, to the extent
possible. All gaps and reconstructions are marked.

We apply two techniques, developed within the natural language
processing community, to the DDBDP. The first, statistical language
modeling, has been widely used in many applications, including speech
recognition and spelling correction. Given a "context" consisting of a
short sequence of words, a statistical language model predicts the
next word in the sequence. Such models can therefore be used to
reconstruct papyri where words have been nibbled away by rodents or
otherwise destroyed. In general, the more formulaic the language, the
better the predictions. Documentary papyri frequently consist of
highly formulaic language, thereby facilitating good
predictions. Although statistical language models cannot replace the
work of trained papyrologists, they can augment papyrologists' work by
providing a broad range of hypothetical reconstructions based on
statistical patterns in the entire corpus, which is too large for any
one person can be familiar with. Furthermore, associating a
probability with each hypothetical reconstruction means that the
variability of reconstructions can be more easily explored.

The second technique, statistical topic modeling, involves clustering
words within documents into "topics" or groups of semantically related
words. Given a corpus, a statistical topic model automatically infers
the words that comprise each topic cluster, as well as the topic
clusters that occur in each document. Inference requires no human
intervention. The topic clusters inferred for the DDBDP include words
for Hellenistic rulers (Alexander, Arsinoe, Ptolemy), agricultural
products (wheat, barley, beans) and sums of money (obols,
drachmas). Topic clusters can be used to develop enhanced search
interfaces that allow researchers to find not only those documents
that contain particular query terms, but also documents that contain
semantically related terms. Additionally, topic clusters can provide a
broad semantic overview of an entire corpus and can be used to analyze
the temporal and spatial evolution and distribution of language.},
