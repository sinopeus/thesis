I owe profound thanks to several people for the following
work. 

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, dr. Toon Van Hal, who from
the get-go demonstrated a very open-minded attitude in the face of
unorthodox subject matter for a classical philology thesis. He has
demonstrated exemplary patience with the stop-start rhythm of
development of this work. His corrections, suggestions and occasional
nudges (usually delivered electronically and with utmost tact) were an
invaluable help and encouragement. It is evident that without him,
this work would not have been possible.

Next, I would like to thank dr. Francis Maes, until recently a
postgraduate student at the Department of Computer Science at the KU
Leuven Faculty of Science, who during a conversation on this thesis
directed me to a set of state-of-the-art papers on machine learning
for natural language processing. His suggestions form the
methodological bedrock of this work in its current form.

I would also like to extend my thanks to my godmother Mar\'ia
Aguililla, who immediately accepted to proofread this work and did so
diligently, as well as Erwin De Koster for temporarily providing me
with computational power in the form of an iMac.

Finally, I would like to thank all those who offered me support and
lended me their proverbial ear when the going got rough, most of whom
definitely know who they are: they are too many to number here and I
fear leaving any of them out; therefore I'll not mention any of
them. If any of them read this, may they know that in my mind, they
are not forgotten.

Two of them I mention, for they are the most important among all
these: my parents, who have been unflagging in their encouragement,
interest and support. They have enabled me to continue work on this
thesis and to pursue my study of computer science, which has granted
me the technical knowledge necessary to complete this work. Apart from
this, they are simply wonderful, strong, bright and loving people. To
them I owe the greatest thanks of all.
